# Range feature SPEC review report

## Current gate

Technical state: Ready for scoped delegated document review; acceptance pending. Reviewed `FEATURE-SPEC.md` blob `ad87c3f9daca1e6fba0c0097e6ee05397711158a`; no children. Governing default baseline `e7cae5b2216ff7dd311b6f7296d829d1927a6a8a`: PROJECT `396d252178e097bde725121d1b89abc6e78d629f`, ARCHITECTURE `7787992d419a44870722f4c3c6c677ef6b04a0e3`, DECOMPOSITION `4a559eed6e875435537a0d7befea7dc4c67430f2`, SPEC `6e406906e53b643695e2c455151e46a0dafd743c`. The supplied preparation brief activates their deferred range contracts; relevant observed JSON controller/core were inspected at `e63b8946bbb99347b0f73f070f9c728945ee5925`.

## Initial owner assessment

On 2026-10-10, sdd-specify compared the full delta against governing F-001–F-004, R-001–R-013 and C-002–C-010. Grammar includes both spellings, duplicate detection, ASCII positivity/order and conversion-guard independence. Selection preserves shared CRLF/CR/LF segments after exactly one whole-input normalization and complete strict decode. Error/status/output and handle/input preservation remain compatible. Public API and stdin boundaries remain explicit. Named-file JSON delivery requires the published JSON increment at future execution; preparation does not integrate the incomplete phase.

| Coverage | Design and acceptance assessment |
| --- | --- |
| F-001 | C-007 validates before C-005; full invalid matrix, enormous decimals, option ordering and `--` are objectively checkable. |
| F-002 | C-002/C-003/C-004/C-005/C-010 preserve complete-decode, selected terminators and exposed interior BOM. Success examples cover EOF, blank, mixed, BOM and Unicode cases. |
| F-003 | C-006/C-008/C-009 preserve public whole-input API and named-file text/JSON/errors; future stdin is source-independent and outside delivery. |
| F-004 | Nonempty product suites, acquisition seam checks, real subprocesses, runnable docs and isolated extraction provide distinct acceptance paths. |

No confirmed conformance finding or consequential decision is unresolved. Main design is sufficient; optional design overlays would repeat existing accepted boundaries. Markdown heading/table separation, scoped local links and artifact ownership were inspected. No code, product tests, distribution or hosted projection was executed. Ready is document QC only and does not imply concrete acceptance, execution eligibility or implemented capability. PLAN derivation waits for the coordinator's exact-artifact decision.
